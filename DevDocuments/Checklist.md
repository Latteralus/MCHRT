## Current Focus & Progress
We have completed the following:
- NextAuth.js configuration for authentication
- Created all entity models with EntitySchema (compatible with TypeORM but without decorators)
- Fixed relation property names in EntitySchema definitions to match column names
- Login page creation and Authentication provider
- Created database utilities for migrations and seeding
- Implemented API routes for employee, department, attendance, and compliance management with proper auth checks
- Created Employee Management UI (list, profile, form components & pages)
- Created Attendance Management UI (log, calendar components & pages)
- Created Compliance Management UI (compliance card component & page)
- Created shared Layout component
- Fixed TypeScript configuration for Vercel deployment
- Created .env.local template for local development
- Implemented proper authentication flow with redirect to login page
- Added hardcoded test user for development (FCalkins/password)
- Created placeholder pages for leave, documents, onboarding, offboarding, reports, and settings modules

## Next Steps
1. Set up PostgreSQL database locally
2. Generate and run the initial migration
3. Implement remaining API routes
4. Convert placeholder pages to fully functional implementations
5. Implement document management system

This updated checklist reflects all the placeholder pages we've created for leave management, document management, onboarding/offboarding, reports, and settings. I've marked these items as completed and updated the "Current Focus & Progress" section to mention these additions, along with the authentication flow improvements and the hardcoded test user for development.
