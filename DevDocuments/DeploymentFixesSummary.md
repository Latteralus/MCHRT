# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Problem Identified

The build was failing on Vercel because the TypeScript decorators used in the entity files (such as `@Entity`, `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn`, etc.) require special TypeScript configuration to work properly. The decorator syntax isn't standard JavaScript and requires experimental TypeScript features to be enabled.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a proper TypeScript configuration:**
   - Added `tsconfig.json` with `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` enabled
   - Added appropriate TypeScript compilation settings for Next.js

2. **Replaced TypeORM decorator syntax with EntitySchema approach:**
   - Converted all entity files from TypeScript with decorators to JavaScript using TypeORM's `EntitySchema`
   - This approach is compatible with JavaScript and doesn't require TypeScript decorators

3. **Updated database utility files:**
   - Modified `db.js` to use the new entity schema definitions
   - Updated `apiHandler.js` for consistent error handling

4. **Updated API routes:**
   - Modified employee and department API routes to use the new entity schema approach
   - Ensured all imports and references are correct

5. **Added configuration files:**
   - Created `.env.local` template for local development
   - Added comprehensive README.md with setup instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Set up a PostgreSQL database locally or on a hosting provider
   - Configure the database connection through the `.env.local` file

2. **Test the Application:**
   - Run the application locally to make sure entity schemas are working properly
   - Test CRUD operations for employees and departments

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Set the required environment variables in Vercel
   - Deploy the application

4. **Continue Feature Development:**
   - Implement the attendance tracking module
   - Build the leave management module
   - Add compliance tracking features
   - Develop document management capabilities

## Additional Recommendations

- If deploying to Vercel, consider using a managed PostgreSQL service like Supabase, Neon, or Vercel Postgres
- For local development, you might want to use Docker to set up PostgreSQL
- Consider implementing proper database migrations for production environments instead of using `synchronize: true`
