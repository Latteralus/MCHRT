## Implementation Priorities

Based on the development plan and current progress, here are the immediate next steps to focus on:

1. **Database & Authentication Setup**
   - Configure TypeORM and PostgreSQL connection
   - Implement NextAuth for user authentication
   - Define core entity models

2. **API Routes Development**
   - Build out the employee management API routes first
   - Implement role-based access control

3. **Core UI Components**
   - Complete the employee management interface
   - Build attendance and leave management UI

4. **Essential Features First**
   - Focus on employee, attendance, and leave management as the core functionality
   - Defer more complex features like document management and analytics until the core is solid

## Technical Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance
- Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all data access
- Use the TypeORM encryption capabilities or consider additional encryption libraries

### Role-Based Access Control
- Use department-based filtering in all API routes
- Implement middleware to validate user permissions
- Ensure UI components respect user roles and permissions

### Scalability
- While designed for ~250 employees, ensure database queries are optimized
- Use pagination for list views to manage data loading
- Consider indexing frequently queried fields in the database

### Maintenance
- Document all entity relationships and API endpoints
- Set up automated testing for core functionality
- Prepare migration strategies for future updates

## Conclusion

This build plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the Mountain Care HR Management platform. By following this phased approach, you'll build a robust, secure, and user-friendly system that meets the requirements specified in the development plan.

The immediate focus should be on setting up the database, authentication system, and core entity models, followed by implementing the essential modules like employee management, attendance tracking, and leave management. With this foundation in place, you can then build out the more advanced features like compliance management, document handling, and reporting.
