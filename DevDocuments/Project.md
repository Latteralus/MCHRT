## Current Status & Next Steps (As of 2025-03-28 ~01:50 AM MDT)

**Current Focus:** Phase 8 - Testing & Documentation (Debugging Jest Integration Tests)

**Completed:**
- Phase 1: All items completed.
- Phase 2: All items completed.
- Phase 3: All items completed.
- Phase 4: All items completed (excluding deferred testing).
- Phase 5: Core structure implemented (API routes, basic components). UI integration and refinement pending.
- Phase 6: All items completed (Dashboard layout, widgets connected, reports page structure, export button). API logic uses placeholders.
- Phase 7: All items completed (Templates created, basic reminder infrastructure, basic task management interface). Email reminders use placeholders.
- Phase 8: Unit test for `leaveBalanceService` complete. Basic API integration tests written for core modules, but blocked by a persistent Jest initialization error.

**Where We Left Off:**
- Attempting to run API integration tests (`npm test`).
- Tests consistently fail with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.` error, originating from model initialization (`Model.init`) which calls `getSequelizeInstance()` before the instance is set by `tests/db-setup.ts`'s `beforeAll` hook.

**Next Steps (Debugging):**
1.  **Investigate Jest Module Loading:** The core issue seems to be Jest loading/transforming modules (specifically the models) before the `beforeAll` hook in `tests/db-setup.ts` can create and set the Sequelize instance.
2.  **Alternative Initialization:** Explore alternative Jest setup methods (e.g., `globalSetup`, `setupFilesAfterEnv`) to ensure Sequelize is initialized globally before any test files are processed.
3.  **Simplify Further:** Temporarily remove `next/jest` wrapper or simplify `jest.config.js` to rule out configuration conflicts.
4.  **Consult Jest/Sequelize Docs:** Review documentation for best practices regarding asynchronous setup and module mocking/loading order in Jest.

## Jest Integration Test Debugging Notes (2025-03-28)

**Problem:** API integration tests consistently fail with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.` This error occurs because Sequelize models (e.g., `User`, `Employee`) are being imported and initialized (calling `Model.init`, which uses `getSequelizeInstance`) at the top level of the test files, *before* the `beforeAll` hook in `tests/db-setup.ts` has a chance to create the Sequelize instance using the test configuration and set it via `setSequelizeInstance`.

**Attempted Fixes:**

1.  **Refactored DB Initialization:**
    *   Moved config loading and Sequelize instance creation out of `src/db/mockDbSetup.ts` and `src/db/index.ts`.
    *   Created `initializeSequelize` and later `setSequelizeInstance`/`getSequelizeInstance` functions in `src/db/mockDbSetup.ts`.
    *   Updated models to use `getSequelizeInstance()`.
    *   Made `tests/db-setup.ts` responsible for importing the test config, creating the instance, and calling `setSequelizeInstance` within `beforeAll`.
    *   *Result:* Error changed from `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'test')` (config undefined) to `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.` (instance not set yet).

2.  **Configuration File Handling:**
    *   Renamed `config/config.js` to `src/config/config.ts`.
    *   Updated `config.ts` to use ES Module exports (`export const dbConfig`).
    *   Tried various import paths in `src/db/index.ts` and `tests/db-setup.ts` (relative, alias `@/`, dynamic `import()`).
    *   *Result:* Did not resolve the core initialization order issue.

3.  **Jest Environment:**
    *   Ensured `NODE_ENV=test` is set using `cross-env` in `package.json` test script.
    *   Cleared Jest cache (`--clearCache`).
    *   *Result:* No change in the error.

4.  **Delayed Imports in Test Files:**
    *   Refactored `tests/api/employees.test.ts` (and subsequently others) to declare model/fixture variables in the `describe` scope and perform dynamic `import()` within `beforeAll`, *after* calling `setupTestDb`.
    *   *Result:* Still failed with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.`, indicating the models are likely still being processed/imported by Jest before `beforeAll` completes its setup, despite the dynamic import syntax.

**Conclusion:** The fundamental issue appears to be Jest's module execution order interacting with Sequelize model definitions that rely on a globally available (but asynchronously initialized) instance. The top-level model imports in the test files trigger `Model.init` too early.

**Next Debugging Ideas:**

*   **Jest Global Setup:** Use Jest's `globalSetup` configuration option to run the database initialization *once* before all test suites. This might guarantee the instance is ready before any test file code executes.
*   **Jest `setupFilesAfterEnv`:** Use `setupFilesAfterEnv` to run the DB setup. While typically for test framework setup, it runs before tests in a suite, but *after* the environment is set up, which might be sufficient if `globalSetup` is too complex.
*   **Manual Mocking:** Explicitly mock the models during the test setup phase and only unmock/import them after `beforeAll`.
*   **Review `next/jest`:** Investigate if the `next/jest` wrapper introduces specific behaviors affecting module loading order or transformations.

## Vercel Build Debugging Notes (2025-03-28 ~03:00 AM MDT)

**Problem:** Encountered a series of TypeScript and module resolution errors during Vercel builds after recent changes.

**Debugging Steps & Fixes:**

1.  **`src/pages/api/compliance/[id].ts` - Type Errors:**
    *   Initial Error: `Interface 'ComplianceWithEmployee' incorrectly extends interface 'Compliance'` due to `employee?: Employee | null`.
        *   *Fix:* Changed type to `employee?: Employee`.
    *   Subsequent Errors: `Type 'Employee | undefined' is not assignable to type 'Employee'` and `'employee' is possibly 'undefined'` when accessing `employee.userId` or `employee.departmentId` after conditional checks.
        *   *Fix:* Added non-null assertions (`employee!`) where TypeScript couldn't infer non-null status based on prior checks.
    *   Final Error: `Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number | undefined'` when passing `userDepartmentId` to `checkAccess`.
        *   *Fix:* Used nullish coalescing (`userDepartmentId ?? undefined`) in the function call to convert potential `null` to `undefined`.

2.  **`src/pages/api/leave/[id]/approve.ts` - Import & Type Errors:**
    *   Error: `Module '"'db"'' has no exported member 'sequelize'`. (Build log showed corrupted path `''db''`, but actual file path `@/db` was correct).
        *   *Investigation:* Checked `src/db/index.ts` and `src/db/mockDbSetup.ts`. Confirmed `sequelize` instance is accessed via `getSequelizeInstance()`.
        *   *Fix:* Removed `sequelize` from `@/db` import, imported `getSequelizeInstance` from `@/db/mockDbSetup`, and replaced `sequelize.transaction()` with `getSequelizeInstance().transaction()`.
    *   Error: `Argument of type 'Date' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'` for `calculateLeaveDuration`.
        *   *Fix:* Converted `Date` objects to ISO strings using `.toISOString()`.
    *   Error: Duplicate argument `leaveRequest.leaveType` passed to `deductLeaveBalance`.
        *   *Fix:* Removed the duplicate argument.
    *   (Potential Error): Initial TS error suggested `deductLeaveBalance` expected `number` for `leaveType`, but function signature confirmed `string`. Assumed TS error was stale.

3.  **`src/pages/api/leave/index.ts` - Redeclaration Error:**
    *   Error: `Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'employeeId'`.
        *   *Fix:* Removed duplicate destructuring assignment of `req.query`.

4.  **`src/pages/index.tsx` - Type Error:**
    *   Error: `Property 'username' does not exist on type '{...}'` when accessing `session.user.username`.
        *   *Fix:* Removed the fallback access to `session.user.username`.

5.  **`tests/db-setup.ts` - Module Resolution Error:**
    *   Error: `Cannot find module 'umzug/storage/sequelize'`.
        *   *Investigation:* Checked `package.json`, found `umzug` dependency was missing.
        *   *Fix 1:* Installed `umzug` (`npm install umzug@^2.3.0`).
        *   *Fix 2 (Error persisted):* Changed import from `import { SequelizeStorage } from 'umzug/storage/sequelize'` to `import { Umzug, SequelizeStorage } from 'umzug'`.

**Outcome:** After these fixes, the Vercel build process is expected to succeed.
