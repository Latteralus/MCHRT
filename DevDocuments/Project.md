## Current Status & Next Steps (As of 2025-03-28 ~12:18 PM MDT)

**Current Focus:** Phase 8 - Testing & Documentation (Running integration tests)

**Completed:**
- Phase 1: All items completed.
- Phase 2: All items completed. Added admin user seeder. Fixed Sequelize CLI config path.
- Phase 3: All items completed.
- Phase 4: All items completed (excluding deferred testing).
- Phase 5: Core structure implemented.
- Phase 6: All items completed.
- Phase 7: All items completed.
- Phase 8:
    - Unit test for `leaveBalanceService` fixed and passing.
    - Basic API integration tests written.
    - **Jest/Sequelize initialization issue resolved** by creating Sequelize instance synchronously and using `sync({ force: true })` in `clearTestDb`.
    - Several API test failures fixed (response format, payload format, fixture dependencies).
- Phase 9: Login page layout bug fixed. Vercel build errors related to types and imports fixed.

**Where We Left Off:**
- Running API integration tests (`npm test`).
- Individual test files (e.g., `employees.test.ts`, `attendance.test.ts`) pass when run in isolation (`npm test <path>`).
- Running the full test suite (`npm test` or `npm test -- --runInBand`) still results in failures (e.g., `UNIQUE constraint failed`, `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`, API logic errors).
- This indicates **test isolation issues** where state from one test file seems to interfere with subsequent files, even when run sequentially in the same process. The `clearTestDb` function using `sync({ force: true })` doesn't seem sufficient to prevent this cross-file interference.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Continue Phase 8:** Proceed with writing further integration tests and documentation, running tests individually or in small groups as needed.
2.  **(Optional/Deferred) Investigate Full Suite Isolation:** If running the *entire* suite with `npm test` is critical, further investigation is needed. This might involve:
    *   Deep diving into Jest's execution context and potential memory leaks.
    *   Exploring alternative test runners or setup strategies (e.g., separate DB files per test suite).
    *   Ensuring no asynchronous operations are left dangling after tests complete.

## Jest Integration Test Debugging Notes (Updated 2025-03-28 ~12:18 PM MDT)

**Problem:** Initial attempts to run integration tests failed due to `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.` errors. Subsequent fixes led to `no such table` errors, and then `UNIQUE constraint failed` or `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` errors when running the full suite.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1.  **Initialization Error:** Caused by a race condition where model files (calling `getSequelizeInstance` during `Model.init`) were loaded by Jest before the asynchronous `setupTestDb` hook finished creating the Sequelize instance.
2.  **`no such table` Error:** Occurred when `clearTestDb` (running `beforeEach`) executed before `setupTestDb` (running `beforeAll`) had finished creating tables via migrations or `sync`.
3.  **Constraint Errors (Full Suite):** Likely caused by inadequate test isolation between files, even with `--runInBand`. The `clearTestDb` function (using either `destroy` or `sync({ force: true })`) doesn't seem to guarantee a perfectly clean slate when multiple test files run sequentially in the same process, leading to leftover data causing unique or foreign key violations in subsequent tests.

**Resolution Steps Taken:**

1.  **Synchronous Instance Creation:** Modified `src/db/mockDbSetup.ts` to create the Sequelize instance synchronously on module load. This resolved the initial `Sequelize has not been initialized` error.
2.  **Switched to `sync({ force: true })`:** Replaced Umzug migrations with `sequelize.sync({ force: true })` in `setupTestDb` to ensure schema matches models.
3.  **Refined `clearTestDb`:** Experimented with `destroy` loops vs. `sync({ force: true })` in the `beforeEach` hook. `sync({ force: true })` proved necessary for resetting state reliably *within* a single test file run sequentially, but still insufficient for full suite isolation. Reverted to `destroy` loop and back to `sync({ force: true })` multiple times while debugging related fixture issues. The final state uses `sync({ force: true })`.
4.  **Ordered Imports:** Ensured models were imported before `sync` and associations after `sync` in `setupTestDb`. Also tried importing associations *before* `sync` in `clearTestDb`, which didn't help. Removed explicit association imports from setup/clear functions as Sequelize handles them via model definitions.
5.  **Fixture Dependencies:** Modified `employeeFixtures` and `departmentFixtures` to ensure dependent `User` and `Department` records are created if not provided via overrides.
6.  **Username Uniqueness:** Modified `userFixtures` to use UUIDs for usernames to prevent collisions within a single test file execution. Reverted this while debugging `clearTestDb`, then potentially re-applied (final state uses UUIDs). *Correction: Final state uses faker + random numbers, not UUIDs.*
7.  **API/Test Logic Fixes:** Corrected assertions and payload formats in `attendance` and `compliance` tests based on actual API behavior (checking correct response property, using correct time formats).
8.  **Sequential Execution:** Used `jest --runInBand` to prevent parallel file execution, which helped isolate some issues but didn't solve the core state leakage problem between files.
9.  **Isolated File Testing:** Confirmed that individual test files (e.g., `employees.test.ts`, `attendance.test.ts`) pass when run alone, indicating the core logic within them is sound.

**Conclusion:** The primary blocker (Sequelize initialization) is resolved. Integration tests *can* be written and run successfully in isolation. However, running the *entire suite* reliably fails due to state not being perfectly reset between test files by the current `clearTestDb` implementation.

**Next Steps (Testing):**
*   Run tests individually (`npm test <path>`) or in small groups during development.
*   Defer further investigation into full suite isolation issues unless it becomes a critical blocker.

## Vercel Build & UI Debugging Notes (Updated 2025-03-28 ~11:07 AM MDT)

**Problem:** Encountered a series of TypeScript, module resolution, and UI layout errors during Vercel builds and local testing after recent changes.

**Debugging Steps & Fixes:**

1.  **`src/pages/api/compliance/[id].ts` - Type Errors:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
2.  **`src/pages/api/leave/[id]/approve.ts` - Import & Type Errors:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
3.  **`src/pages/api/leave/index.ts` - Redeclaration Error:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
4.  **`src/pages/index.tsx` - Type Error:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
5.  **`tests/db-setup.ts` - Module Resolution & Type Errors:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
6.  **`src/modules/leave/services/leaveAccrualService.ts` - Import Error & Typo:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
7.  **`tests/fixtures/attendanceFixtures.ts` - Build Error:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
8.  **Login Page Layout (`src/pages/login.tsx`, `src/pages/_app.tsx`) - UI Bug:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
9.  **Vercel Build (`tests/fixtures/*.ts`) - Type Errors:** Fixed type mismatches (`managerId: null` vs `number | undefined`, `hireDate: string` vs `Date | undefined`) by adjusting property assignment order in fixtures.
10. **Vercel Build (`tests/fixtures/userFixtures.ts`) - Type Errors:** Fixed incorrect property names (`name` vs `username`, `password` vs `passwordHash`) and removed non-existent properties (`email`, `isActive`) based on `User` model.
11. **`tests/fixtures/employeeFixtures.ts` - Missing Type:** Fixed by exporting `EmployeeCreationAttributes` from the model file.
12. **`src/types/next-auth.d.ts` & Test Mocks:** Added missing `employeeId` to session type definition and removed incorrect `username` from test mocks.
13. **Sequelize CLI Config:** Created `src/config/config.js` and updated `.sequelizerc` for CLI compatibility. Fixed seeder import issue by using hardcoded role string. Added admin user seeder.

**Outcome:** Vercel builds and local TypeScript checks pass. Login page layout is correct. Admin user seeder created. **Jest integration tests are unblocked but exhibit isolation issues when running the full suite.**
