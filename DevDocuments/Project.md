## Current Status & Next Steps (As of 2025-03-28 ~11:07 AM MDT)

**Current Focus:** Phase 8 - Testing & Documentation (Debugging Jest Integration Tests)

**Completed:**
- Phase 1: All items completed.
- Phase 2: All items completed. Added admin user seeder. Fixed Sequelize CLI config path.
- Phase 3: All items completed.
- Phase 4: All items completed (excluding deferred testing).
- Phase 5: Core structure implemented.
- Phase 6: All items completed.
- Phase 7: All items completed.
- Phase 8: Unit test for `leaveBalanceService` written but failing due to setup. Basic API integration tests written but blocked.
- Phase 9: Login page layout bug fixed. Vercel build errors related to types and imports fixed.

**Where We Left Off:**
- Attempting to run API integration tests (`npm test`).
- Tests consistently fail with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.` error.
- The error occurs even when using `setupFilesAfterEnv` with `beforeAll` hooks in `jest.setup.ts` and dynamic imports (`import()`) within the test files' `beforeAll` hooks.
- The root cause appears to be that Jest loads the test files and their static dependencies (API handlers -> models -> `getSequelizeInstance`) *before* the asynchronous database setup (`setupTestDb` called from `jest.setup.ts`'s `beforeAll`) fully completes and sets the Sequelize instance.

**Next Steps (Debugging):**
1.  **Confirm Dynamic Import Pattern:** Double-check all API test files (`tests/api/*.test.ts`) ensure *all* imports related to API handlers, models, and fixtures are performed dynamically within a `beforeAll` hook, not statically at the top level.
2.  **Investigate `jest.setup.ts` Execution:** Add logging within `jest.setup.ts`'s `beforeAll` and the test files' `beforeAll` to confirm the execution order relative to module loading.
3.  **Simplify `tests/db-setup.ts` Further:** Temporarily remove the dynamic model/association imports from `setupTestDb` entirely to see if the basic instance creation and migration run successfully in `beforeAll` without interference.
4.  **Manual Mocking:** As a last resort, explore explicitly mocking the Sequelize models (`User`, `Employee`, etc.) using `jest.mock()` at the top of test files and only importing the real implementations within tests after setup.
5.  **Review `next/jest` Interaction:** Re-evaluate if the `next/jest` wrapper, despite being standard, has specific interactions with asynchronous setup hooks that cause this behavior.

## Jest Integration Test Debugging Notes (Updated 2025-03-28 ~11:07 AM MDT)

**Problem:** API integration tests consistently fail with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.` This error occurs because Sequelize models (e.g., `User`, `Employee`) are being imported and initialized (calling `Model.init`, which uses `getSequelizeInstance`) *before* the asynchronous `setupTestDb` function (called via `beforeAll` in `jest.setup.ts`) has completed its setup and called `setSequelizeInstance`.

**Attempted Fixes:**

1.  **Refactored DB Initialization:** (See previous notes) - Led to the current state where `mockDbSetup.ts` provides `set/getSequelizeInstance`.
2.  **Configuration File Handling:** (See previous notes) - Resolved issues with Sequelize CLI reading config.
3.  **Jest Environment:** (See previous notes) - No change.
4.  **Delayed Imports in Test Files (Initial Attempt):** (See previous notes) - Failed, likely due to incomplete application or other errors masking the result.
5.  **`tests/db-setup.ts` Umzug Configuration:** (See previous notes) - Resolved TS errors.
6.  **Jest `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown`:**
    *   Created `global-setup.ts` to call `setupTestDb` and `global-teardown.ts` to call `teardownTestDb`.
    *   Configured `jest.config.js` to use these.
    *   Modified `jest.setup.ts` to only contain `beforeEach(clearTestDb)`.
    *   Encountered issues resolving path aliases (`@/`) within `globalSetup` context, even with `ts-jest` path mapping configured.
    *   Reverted alias imports in `db-setup.ts`, `associations.ts`, and models to relative paths for `mockDbSetup`.
    *   Still failed, with errors indicating the instance/tables set up in `globalSetup` were not available to the test execution context (`beforeEach` failed with `no such table`).
    *   *Result:* `globalSetup` seems to run in a separate context from the tests and `setupFilesAfterEnv`, making it unsuitable for sharing the initialized Sequelize instance directly. Reverted this approach.
7.  **`ts-jest` without `next/jest` wrapper:**
    *   Installed `ts-jest`.
    *   Modified `jest.config.js` to use `preset: 'ts-jest'` and configure `transform` for `ts-jest`, including `babelConfig: true`.
    *   Encountered JSX parsing errors because `next/babel` preset was no longer implicitly applied.
    *   *Result:* Reverted to using `next/jest` wrapper as it handles necessary Babel transforms automatically.
8.  **`setupFilesAfterEnv` with Dynamic Imports (Revisited):**
    *   Configured `jest.config.js` to use `next/jest` and `setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts']`.
    *   Ensured `jest.setup.ts` calls `setupTestDb` in `beforeAll`, `teardownTestDb` in `afterAll`, and `clearTestDb` in `beforeEach`.
    *   Modified all API test files (`tests/api/*.test.ts`) to dynamically import handlers, models, and fixtures using `await import(...)` inside a `beforeAll` hook within the `describe` block.
    *   *Result:* Still fails with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.`. The error trace indicates the failure occurs when the dynamic imports within the test file's `beforeAll` trigger model loading before the `setupTestDb` call (from `jest.setup.ts`'s `beforeAll`) has finished.
9.  **Synchronous Instance Creation in `db-setup.ts`:**
    *   Modified `tests/db-setup.ts` to create and set the Sequelize instance synchronously at the top level, leaving only async operations (migrations, association imports) in the `setupTestDb` function called by `jest.setup.ts`'s `beforeAll`.
    *   *Result:* Still fails with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.`. The error occurs during the `beforeEach` hook when `clearTestDb` tries to access the instance, suggesting the instance set synchronously isn't available or the tables weren't created correctly due to timing. Reverted this approach.
10. **Simplified `setupTestDb` (Removing Model/Assoc Imports):**
    *   Modified `tests/db-setup.ts` so `setupTestDb` only creates/sets the instance and runs migrations. Test files dynamically import models/fixtures/handlers in their `beforeAll`.
    *   *Result:* Still fails with `Sequelize has not been initialized or set.`. Error occurs when test files dynamically import models/handlers in their `beforeAll`, indicating `setupTestDb` hasn't finished.

**Conclusion:** The core problem remains the race condition between Jest loading modules required by the tests (even via dynamic `import()` in `beforeAll`) and the completion of the asynchronous database setup defined in `jest.setup.ts`'s `beforeAll`. The `next/jest` wrapper seems necessary for easy JSX/TS transformation but doesn't inherently solve this setup timing issue. The dynamic imports in the test files' `beforeAll` hooks are still executing before the `beforeAll` hook in `jest.setup.ts` finishes its asynchronous work.

**Next Debugging Ideas:**

*   **Isolate `jest.setup.ts`:** Ensure `jest.setup.ts` *only* contains the `beforeAll(setupTestDb)`, `afterAll(teardownTestDb)`, and `beforeEach(clearTestDb)` calls, with `setupTestDb` performing all necessary async setup (instance creation, migrations, model/association loading).
*   **Investigate `await` in `beforeAll`:** Confirm that Jest correctly awaits the `async` `beforeAll` hook in `jest.setup.ts` before proceeding to the test file's `beforeAll` hook. Add console logs at the start and end of `setupTestDb` and the start of the test file's `beforeAll` to verify timing.
*   **Manual Mocking:** Explore explicitly mocking the Sequelize models (`User`, `Employee`, etc.) using `jest.mock()` at the top of test files and only importing the real implementations within tests after setup. This is less ideal for integration tests but might be a necessary workaround.

## Vercel Build & UI Debugging Notes (Updated 2025-03-28 ~11:07 AM MDT)

**Problem:** Encountered a series of TypeScript, module resolution, and UI layout errors during Vercel builds and local testing after recent changes.

**Debugging Steps & Fixes:**

1.  **`src/pages/api/compliance/[id].ts` - Type Errors:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
2.  **`src/pages/api/leave/[id]/approve.ts` - Import & Type Errors:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
3.  **`src/pages/api/leave/index.ts` - Redeclaration Error:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
4.  **`src/pages/index.tsx` - Type Error:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
5.  **`tests/db-setup.ts` - Module Resolution & Type Errors:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
6.  **`src/modules/leave/services/leaveAccrualService.ts` - Import Error & Typo:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
7.  **`tests/fixtures/attendanceFixtures.ts` - Build Error:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
8.  **Login Page Layout (`src/pages/login.tsx`, `src/pages/_app.tsx`) - UI Bug:** (See previous notes) - Fixed.
9.  **Vercel Build (`tests/fixtures/*.ts`) - Type Errors:** Fixed type mismatches (`managerId: null` vs `number | undefined`, `hireDate: string` vs `Date | undefined`) by adjusting property assignment order in fixtures.
10. **Vercel Build (`tests/fixtures/userFixtures.ts`) - Type Errors:** Fixed incorrect property names (`name` vs `username`, `password` vs `passwordHash`) and removed non-existent properties (`email`, `isActive`) based on `User` model.
11. **`tests/fixtures/employeeFixtures.ts` - Missing Type:** Fixed by exporting `EmployeeCreationAttributes` from the model file.
12. **`src/types/next-auth.d.ts` & Test Mocks:** Added missing `employeeId` to session type definition and removed incorrect `username` from test mocks.
13. **Sequelize CLI Config:** Created `src/config/config.js` and updated `.sequelizerc` for CLI compatibility. Fixed seeder import issue by using hardcoded role string. Added admin user seeder.

**Outcome:** Vercel builds and local TypeScript checks should now pass. Login page layout is correct. Admin user seeder created. **Jest integration test initialization remains the primary blocker.**
