# TypeScript Annotations in JavaScript Files Fixes

## Issue Identified

We encountered TypeScript compiler errors because TypeScript annotations were being used in JavaScript (.js) files. The error specifically stated:

```
Type annotations can only be used in TypeScript files.
```

This was occurring in utility files like `migration.js` and potentially in `seed.js` as well.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed TypeScript annotations from `migration.js`**:
   - Changed function parameter type annotations (e.g., from `name: string` to just `name`)
   - Removed return type annotations
   - Kept the same functionality but with pure JavaScript syntax

2. **Updated `seed.js` to remove any TypeScript-specific syntax**:
   - Replaced TypeScript-style optional chaining with JavaScript-compatible patterns
   - Ensured all functions use regular JavaScript parameter definitions without type annotations
   - Maintained the same seeding logic and functionality

## Example Change

Before:
```javascript
export const generateMigration = async (name: string): Promise<string> => {
  // Function implementation
};
```

After:
```javascript
export const generateMigration = async (name) => {
  // Same function implementation
};
```

## Why This Fix Works

JavaScript files are not processed by the TypeScript compiler for type checking, so including TypeScript syntax in `.js` files will cause errors during compilation. By removing the TypeScript-specific syntax from JavaScript files while maintaining the same logic and functionality, we ensure compatibility with the JavaScript runtime.

## Important Development Practices Going Forward

To maintain a clean codebase that builds successfully:

1. **File Extensions Matter**: 
   - Use `.ts` or `.tsx` for files that contain TypeScript syntax
   - Use `.js` or `.jsx` for pure JavaScript files

2. **TypeScript in JavaScript Files**:
   - Avoid using TypeScript annotations in `.js` files
   - If type checking is needed, consider converting the file to `.ts`
   - Use JSDoc comments for type hints in JavaScript files if necessary

3. **JavaScript in TypeScript Projects**:
   - JavaScript files are valid in TypeScript projects
   - TypeScript will still check JavaScript files for syntax errors, but not type errors
   - TypeScript can check JavaScript files for types if `checkJs` is enabled in `tsconfig.json`

By following these practices, we can maintain a clean separation between TypeScript and JavaScript files while leveraging the benefits of both languages in the project.
